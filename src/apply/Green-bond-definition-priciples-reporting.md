## 定义

### What's Green Bond

**绿色债券是什么？**

绿色债券（英语：Green bond），又名气候债券（英语：Climate bond），是种相对新颖的定息金融产品，指的是为各种为舒缓气候变化问题的项目集资的债务证券。绿色证券的发行量和存量增速迅猛，存量在2016年达到了1,600亿美元，而单计算2016年便有700亿美元的新发行绿色债券。

**The Definition**

> Definition from [investopedia]( https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/green-bond.asp)

A green bond is a type of fixed-income instrument that is specifically earmarked to raise money for climate and environmental projects. These bonds are typically asset-linked and backed by the issuing entity's balance sheet, so they usually carry the same credit rating as their issuers’ other debt obligations.

Dating back to the first decade of the 21st century, green bonds are also referred to as climate bonds.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

- A green bond is a fixed-income instrument designed specifically to support specific climate-related or environmental projects.
- Green bonds typically come with tax incentives to enhance their attractiveness to investors.
- The World Bank issued the first official green bond in 2009.
- Around $157 billion worth of green bonds were issued in 2019.

### History

**2009**： the World Bank issued the first so-labeled green bond for institutional investors.

**2010**：the development of green bond funds, broadening the ability of retail investors to participate in these initiatives. Allianz SE, Axa SA, State Street Corporation, TIAA-CREF, Blackrock, ax World Funds, and HSBC are among the investment companies and asset management firms that have sponsored green bond mutual funds or ETFs.

**2012**, green bond issuance amounted only to 2.6 billion USD. But in 2016, green bonds began to sprout. Much of the action was attributable to Chinese borrowers, who accounted for $32.9 billion of the total, or more than a third of all issuances. But the interest is global, with the European Union and the United States among the leaders too.

**2017**, green bond issuance soared to a record high, accounting for \$161 billion worth of investment worldwide, according to the latest report from the rating agency [Moody's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moodys.asp). Growth slowed a bit in 2018, hitting only ​\$167 billion, but rebounded the following year. 

**2019：** when finally tabulated, Moody's estimates that global issuances could top \$250 billion.﻿ The Climate Bonds Initiative, an international, investor-focused not-for-profit organization, puts the figure at \$257.5 billion.

## 《绿色债券原则》

2021年6月， International Capital Market Association 发布了[绿色债券原则(Green Bond Principles，下称《原则》)2021版](https://www.icmagroup.org/sustainable-finance/the-principles-guidelines-and-handbooks/green-bond-principles-gbp/)([下载](https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Sustainable-finance/2021-updates/Green-Bond-Principles-June-2021-140621.pdf))。与过往不同的是，这一版将社会债券、可持续发展债券指南、可持续发展挂钩债券原则与之相提并论。

> The Green Bond Principles (GBP), together with the Social Bond Principles (SBP),the Sustainability Bond Guidelines (SBG) and the Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles (SLBP) are published under the governance of the Principles. The Principles are a collection of voluntary frameworks with the stated mission and vision of promoting the role that global debt capital markets can play in ﬁnancing progress towards environmental and social sustainability.

此外：

Notably, the 2021 edition of the GBP identiﬁes key recommendations regarding Green Bond Frameworks and External Reviews alongside the four core components of the GBP. It recommends heightened transparency for issuer-level sustainability strategies and commitments, and encourages information, if relevant, on the degree of alignment of projects with ofﬁcial or market-based taxonomies.

除了《原则》的四核心要素：

1. Use of Proceeds （债券资金用途）
2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection （项目评估与遴选流程）
3. Management of Proceeds （募集资金管理）
4. Reporting（报告）

还提到：

- Green Bond Frameworks （绿色债券框架）
- External Reviews （外部审验）

### Green Bond Frameworks

发行人应在该框架中解释是如何应用上述四个核心要素的，并且该框架能被投资者所取用。该框架可涉及到GBP中环境范畴的5个议题：

- climate change mitigation (减缓气候变化所作的努力)
- climate change adaptation （应对气候变化）
- natural resource conservation （环境资源保护）
-  biodiversity conservation （生物多样性保护）
- pollution prevention and control （污染预防和控制）

鼓励发行人根据 [Climate Transition Finance Handbook](https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Green-Bonds/Climate-Transition-Finance-Handbook-December-2020-091220.pdf) ([英文版](/apply/Climate-Transition-Finance-Handbook-2020-English.pdf) 、被译为：[气候转型融资手册](/apply/Climate-Transition-Finance-Handbook-2020-Chinese.pdf)) 进行披露。

### External Reviews 

就所披露的信息、报告进行第三方的外部审验。

### 气候转型融资手册

手册制定的信息披露建议，是基于：

1. 气候转型融资工作组在绿色和社会责任债券原则执行委员会的支持下所开展的工作。该工作组包括来自资本市场的80多家机构代表。
2. 有关行业小组、监管机构和科研机构针对减缓和适应气候变化所进行的分析以及现有的气候变化披露框架。本手册中的建议参考使用了上述框架，并阐明了这些框架应用于有特定募集资金用途的债券或可持续发展挂钩债券的意义。

手册的建议包含四个关键要素：

1. 发行人气候转型战略和公司治理；
2. 业务模式中考虑环境要素的重要性；
3. 气候转型战略应参考具有科学依据的目标和路径；
4. 执行情况有关信息的透明度。

#### Green Building 绿色建筑

*绿色建筑指南*

- **New Buildings**: New construction and the development of buildings must take account of
  their impact on ecosystems and biodiversity. Where no certiﬁcation standard is available or where the certiﬁcation standard referenced does not provide an analysis of location considerations, these should be highlighted in reporting in particular to demonstrate how construction activities have avoided building on land that should be protected, how access to public transportation is incorporated, and any measures taken to offset negative impacts on biodiversity

- **Retroﬁtted Buildings**: The retroﬁt, upgrade or renovation of an existing building, building unit,
  or any building component or system should take into consideration all efforts to improve energy performance (or reduce energy use for comparable quality of enabling environment and for comparable services) in order to meet some minimum energy efficiency criteria whenever this is technically, functionally and economically feasible.

  

  Where both the purpose of the building and its use remain unchanged, the improved performance of the building can be reported against that attained prior to the project. Where the purpose and/or use of the building has been altered, the improved performance should be measured against baselines and benchmarks applicable to new buildings.

- **Energy Use**: The annual energy input to the building in order to satisfy the energy needs
  associated with a typical use of the building and by the building services that provide an enabling environment in the building. It encompasses the amount of energy needed to meet the energy demand associated with, inter alia, energy used for heating, cooling, air-conditioning, ventilation, hot water and lighting.
- **Primary Energy Use**: Energy from renewable and non-renewable sources used in buildings and
  which has not undergone any conversion or transformation process. For further guidance on calculation of Primary Energy Use including renewable energy generated on site, ISO EN standards or applicable national methodologies for energy and carbon performance assessment in buildings
- **Final Energy Use**: The total energy consumed by end-users in their building assets. It is the
  energy which reaches the ﬁnal user’s asset and excludes the energy used by the energy sector itself.
- **Gross Building Area (GBA)**: Gross Building Area, also named Gross Floor Area (“GFA”) corresponds to
  the total ﬂoor area contained in a building measured to the external walls. The physical environmental impact comes from the entire building, and therefore Gross Building Area is more relevant than Gross Letting Area, which is the amount of ﬂoor space available to be rented.
- **Certification Schemes**: While the importance of international certification schemes as industry
  benchmarks is highlighted by their prime position in the proposed Core Indicators, the associated costs and processes may be deemed prohibitive for small local players, or large portfolios of very small assets. Locally applicable proxies may therefore provide a relevant baseline when compatible with the major international certiﬁcation schemes.
