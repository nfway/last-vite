# ESG 为何重要

环境、社会这两个范畴的议题关系到人类整体——原因在于，人类生活中这些议题的影响之中。而管治（Governance），则影响着地球上的各类实体，如经济组织，特别是目前应用最广的经济组织：公司。

所以，环境、社会和管治这三样的影响力几乎涵盖人们生活的方方面面，特别是经济活动的方方面面。而经济活动越来越多地对环境造成影响。为了一个可持续的未来，让商业活动也变得可持续，将是人类恒久的努力方向。

因此，ESG变得极为重要。

## 对于投资者而言

- 当环境、社会的议题逐渐成为主流，越来越多的投资者加入了“负责任”的行列，响应UNPRI的负责任投资原则，这是不可逆转的潮流
- [哈佛法学院的研究表明](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/01/14/esg-matters/)，ESG评分与公司的盈利能力成正比
- 与道琼斯指数和标普500指数相比，MSCI ESG Leader指数具有稳定的超额收益。2011-2017年间，MSCI ESG Leader指数的收益率高於道琼斯指数和标普500指数的收益率。以2011年作为基年，2011-2017年间，MSCI ESG Leader指数投资的累计收益率为114.99%（复利收益率为182.23%），标普500指数为100.85%（复利收益率为146.67%），道琼斯指数为95.77%（复利收益率为140.41%）。 
- 运用ESG投资理念有利于风险控制。ESG作为综合评判公司环境、社会和公司治理能力的指标有利於从非财务角度进行排雷。
- ESG与公司财务绩效有相关性，主要原因为：
  - ESG表现优异的公司能够降低公司特定风险；
  - ESG表现优异的公司对声誉具有积极影响；
  - ESG表现优异能够增强客户黏性，改善公司运营，提升公司财务绩效；
  - ESG表现优异的公司在面临极端下跌环境中，具有更强的抗风险能力。

## 对于监管方

- 当环境、社会议题不可阻挡地成为主流时，对公司等经济实体的这些议题进行强制或半强制披露要求，是符合大众利益的；
- ESG的披露逐渐形成了诸多具体而可行的框架，可作为监管的有效工具。

## 对于经济实体而言

一个经济实体——特别是公司，需要达到可持续的发展，出于下列要求，必须对ESG加以重视

- 出于对环境、社会的负责任态度；
- 出于对股东的负责任态度，要在监管和投资者均支持可持续发展的经济环境里，重视ESG才能提升公司价值——越来越多的投资者开始对ESG有所要求，那么公司也应行动起来；
- 在监管环境下，ESG的披露只会越来越严格，这将逐渐造成逆淘汰；
- 基于顾客、消费者的道义要求，公司必须日趋关注ESG议题。

### How do ESG policies benefit your business? /ESG 政策是如何利于您的事业的？

More and more businesses are being introduced to the multi-faceted and all-permeable benefits of ESG like attracting talent, targeting future consumers, facilitating brand-enhancement and innovation. Overall, ESG equips the business to become resilient in the current and possible future scenarios. Let us break down its major benefits in detail to understand why ESG is more important now than ever:

**Adds to the top-line growth**

It’s easier for businesses to enter new markets and expand their operations in the existing markets if they have a strong ESG approach. Governments facilitate access by giving licenses and issuing permissions to such companies.

[As per GreenPrint’s Business of Sustainability Index](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210322005061/en/GreenPrint-Survey-Finds-Consumers-Want-to-Buy-Eco-Friendly-Products-but-Don%E2%80%99t-Know-How-to-Identify-Them) report released in March 2021, 75% of Millennials are willing to pay more for an environmentally sustainable product in the US and 77% of the overall sample size are concerned about the environmental impact of products they buy.

**Leads to reduction in the costs**

Companies which switch to more sustainable methods of production tend to be more efficient and reduce their costs. One such example is[ Nestlé](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/nestle-to-spend-up-to-2-1-billion-on-recycled-plastic-plan), which announced that it will invest up to USD 2.1 billion by 2025 to shift from virgin plastic packaging to food-grade recycled plastics and the development of other sustainable packaging solutions. This will not only help it cut its carbon footprint but also save it from non-compliance costs among different geographies where it operates and have stricter laws related to the use of plastic packaging.

**Effective management of regulatory compliances and stakeholders**

All businesses are affected by some or other forms of regulations depending upon the markets they operate. The business with strong ESG measures, especially on Governance, invite less scrutiny from the regulators and have greater operational freedom. They also face less pressure from climate change from activists, employee unions etc. The consumers also prefer such brands too. For example, [Starbucks](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/13/starbucks-offers-to-pay-health-insurance-for-parents-of-some-china-employees.html) introduced “Starbucks China Parent Care Program” in 2017 which provided health coverage to over 10,000 parents of Starbucks’ employees in China. It was seen as a strategic move as Starbucks planned to expand in China amid the growing trade dispute between USA & China.

**Attracting talent and boosting employee’s productivity**

It is noted that strong companies with good ESG scores attract better talent and have longer retention. Having a clear sustainability agenda generates an internal sense of pride among employees. The younger generation prefers to work for companies with stronger commitments towards society. As per a study by [Cone Communications on Millennial Employee Engagement in 2016](https://www.conecomm.com/research-blog/2016-millennial-employee-engagement-study), 64% of Millennials consider a company’s social and environmental commitments when deciding where to work.

The findings come at a time when sustainable investing is rapidly transforming from a niche of the investment world into what looks like an unstoppable force. Based on U.S. demographic trends, Savita Subramanian, Head of U.S. Equity & Quantitative Strategy for BofA (Bank of America) Global Research, estimates that the amount invested in ESG funds could rise by $15-20 trillion over the next two decades. “That’s equivalent to the size of the S&P 500 today,” she notes.

**Past performance is no guarantee of future results.**

Europe represents almost half of the current $30.7 trillion of investable assets in sustainability funds, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance. “The rise of eco-political parties in power in Europe, a swell of millennials and ‘green’ investors have driven a groundswell of interest and awareness of the potential of ESG as both a financial investment and a way to help achieve broader goals,” says Subramanian.

Awareness also is on the rise among investors and companies in the United States. The Global Primer points to a “sea-change in U.S. corporate responsibility,” where companies are recognizing the importance of investing in employees, taking care of the environment and other issues.

**Avoiding corporate ‘blunders’**

Among U.S. companies on the S&P 500 index, those that scored in the top fifth of ESG rankings outperformed their counterparts in the bottom fifth by at least three percentage points every year for the past five years, the report found. [1]

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The report also found that ESG metrics have shown to be better at signaling a company’s future earnings than traditional financial measures like its level of debt.[2]

They also helped investors avoid losses related to “ESG blunders”—when companies become embroiled in regulatory and/or public relations crises. Such missteps by U.S. companies eliminated more than $500 billion in market capitalization from 2014 to 2019.[3]

“Based on our findings, we believe that ESG considerations are no longer simply another option for investors,” Subramanian says. “They are an essential part of the investing process.”

## 附录：ESG 是如何利于公司和投资者的

**Strong ESG Practices Can Benefit Companies and Investors: Here’s How**

From [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/strong-esg-practices-can-benefit-companies-and-investors-2019-03-13), author: Betsy Atkins

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues should be a top concern of corporate management and boards. There was a time when a public stance on ESG issues was a public relations tactic. However, in today's rapidly changing business climate, attention to ESG issues is becoming critical to long-term competitive success. 

Major institutional investors recognize this and are making it clear that they expect the companies they hold to take a proactive approach to ESG policies and messaging. In [his annual letter](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter) to CEOs, Blackrock's CEO Larry Fink wrote "a company's ability to manage environmental, social, and governance matters demonstrate the leadership and good governance that is so essential to sustainable growth, which is why we are increasingly integrating these issues into our investment process." During the 2017 proxy season, State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) put this ethos into action by [voting against the re-election of directors at 400 companies ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-street-votes-against-400-companies-citing-gender-diversity-1501029490)that SSGA said failed to make any significant effort to appoint women to their all-male boards.

The advantages of proactively tackling ESG issues go beyond appeasing institutional shareholders and creating a good public relations story. A robust ESG program can open up access to large pools of capital, build a stronger corporate brand and promote sustainable long-term growth benefiting companies and investors. Here's how:

**1.Strong ESG programs can increase stock liquidity.**

Individual and institutional investors alike are investing massive pools of capital in corporations that proactively govern and operate in an ethical and sustainable manner. Sustainable and impact investing is actively growing at double-digit rates. In fact, according to the [US SIF Foundation](https://www.ussif.org/files/SIF_Trends_16_Executive_Summary(1).pdf), total U.S.-domiciled investments using sustainable, responsible and impact (SRI) strategies, reached $8.72 trillion, an increase of 33 percent from 2014 and a 14-fold increase since 1995. That represents about one of every 6 dollars under management.

[Investment research](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity) and consulting firms like Sustainanalytics and MSCIhave developed indices that measure and rank companies based upon ESG criteria relative to their industry peers. The investment funds and ETFs that benchmark these indices are raising trillions of dollars to be deployed toward companies that execute sound ESG policies; these are long-term oriented shareholders that can potentially fuel demand for your stock.

Many investment firms are also incorporating ESG evaluations in their portfolio risk assessment, which is a telling indicator that capital will continue to flow towards companies with strong ESG programs and practices.

**2.ESG initiatives can unlock competitive value.**

Companies that recognize the importance of adapting to changing socio-economic and environmental conditions are better able to identify strategic opportunities and meet competitive challenges. Proactive and integrated ESG policies can widen a company's competitive moat relative to other industry players.

Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) learned this as they were trying to expand their market share in China. For years after entering that market, Starbucks struggled to gain momentum on expansion. They stumbled upon the answer when they offered healthcare to their employees' parents. Once they did that, sales growth skyrocketed and now Starbucks has 2,000 stores in one of the fastest growing markets on the globe.

Executives who take steps to improve labor conditions, enhance the diversity of their teams, give back to their communities, and take a stand on sustainable environmental policies also strengthen the company's brand. As millennials in particular become employees, consumers, and investors, they take note of good corporate actors and reward them with loyalty.

**3.A proactive stance on ESG issues can keep activists at bay.**

Activists have used governance weaknesses as a tool in proxy contests and campaigns against companies for years, but increasingly they are targeting management teams and boards that fail to take a proactive stance on potential environmental or social issues.

Companies that proactively address ESG issues can set the bar for the entire industry and at the same time help immunize themselves against activist intervention. Wynn Resorts (Nasdaq: WYNN) recently embraced their commitment to gender diversity by increasing the number of women on their board from one to four. With a board that is 36% female, Wynn is now in the top 40 S&P 500 companies in terms of female board representation.

If your company does become the target of an ESG-focused activist, don't despair. Activist investment firms and hedge funds are establishing their own ESG funds, such as [ValueAct Capital](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/19/jeff-ubbens-valueact-launching-fund-with-social-goal.html) and [Jana Partners](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-janapartners-sting/fields-of-gold-jana-seeks-new-money-allies-with-impact-hedge-fund-idUSKBN1F12L4). Many of these investors are interested in collaborating with companies to develop ESG policies that unlock the long-term value we mentioned above. For example, Jeff Ubben, CEO of ValueAct Capital, recently joined the board of energy company AES Corporation to help continue the company's transition to clean and renewable energy sources (following divestiture of its coal assets).

**4.ESG Investors are "stickier."**

ESG investors are values-based investors who are more interested in what happens during the next decade than the next quarter; they understand that change takes time. Investors incorporating ESG into their mandate often work alongside a company to strengthen it, as they are more interested in building long-term value over a multi-year period than in flipping the stock in the near term for a "sugar high."

**5.Companies that espouse strong ESG values tend to attract and retain the best talent.**

Millennials care deeply that the companies they work for (and the businesses they support) embrace values that are aligned with their own, and environmental and social responsibility are very important to them. Employees who are passionate about the organization, who are loyal, and who feel valued drive an intangible good will that strengthens the brand of the company and improves the overall productivity of the workforce.
