`vuepress-theme-hope` introduces lots of great features. Most of the functions are separated into plugins, which means if you like them, you can use them in other VuePress themes or `@vuepress/theme-default`.

::: info

All the plugin settings are under `themeConfig.plugins`, and the option name is related with their names.
